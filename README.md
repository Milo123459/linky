Everybody hates long ðŸ”—, and Custom link shorteners which can use your domain can be expensive, Welcome to my open source solution to this, just covering database and hosting costs (Both can be clubbed into a single VPS), Linky can make your own custom link shortener within 5$. Just wait for the project to finish, Clone the repo, Keep it alive 24/7 and you're done! Linky works fast like magic with the latest ORM processing your requests and redirecting within milliseconds, and the best part is that you can even have editable, custom links too ðŸ˜². Linky is expected to be complete in the next month (before 4th of November 2021).
